I am so fucking angry at these fascist motherfuckers, peace and love for all my queers and autists

i dont know how else to respond to the current moment

I am among the most powerful, and I feel powerless

to stem the tides of hatred

so please forgive me for writing on the walls

it feels like the only sane response to our collective insanity

which is not even insanity

just stubborn human nature reasserting itself

i am not worried about being tracked by the fbi

or palantir

or etrog

(hi guys)

because nobody gives a shit what i say

i'm just some difficult queer

that management can't control

and nobody likes being made to feel stupid

and i'm bad at not making people feel stupid

because i just never learned to lie

or to decieve

to shuck and jive for the man

these things come so unnaturally to me

what does it even mean to break the law

in a country that has become lawless

so i'm going to write on the walls 

because it's pure unadultarated queer joy

and just remember dolls

goddammit babies, you've gotta be kind
