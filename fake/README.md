These are stencils for the FAKE project.  

*GENDER IS FAKE*
Gender is a construct that is used to force people to conform to societal norms about what we can wear, how we can 
behave, who we can fuck, what kind of job we're allowed to aspire to, and so much other insane bullshit that has nothing to do with your genitalia.

*GOD IS FAKE*
I went through a religious phase as a youth, but I now know that god is fake too.  It's something we tell ourselves so that we can feel some
meaning in a meaningless world and i know i know i want it too, but it's self-deception.  the only thing we have on this planet is each other.
we must learn to love each other.  i have never been more ashamed and afraid to be a jew in this country, and i am so fucking mad at bibi and hamas
for doing this shit to people in the name of the invisible sky man.  religion is just one of many fake systems the powerful use to control women
and queers.

*LAWS ARE FAKE*
Why shouldn't I write on the walls when the goddamn president is jerking off inside his Qatari jet and the Supreme Court is giving the constitution
the finger from Clarence Thomas' FUCKING RV (to sell out your country for a fucking RV you incredible prick).  They pardoned that guy, the q-anon shaman.
A government that does not respect the rule of law does not deserve it's protection either (--Ken White, more or less)

*BORDERS ARE FAKE*
That time that Ted Cruz fled Texas to go to Cancun while the power grid was down was pure comedy gold.  Ted Cruz can go anywhere he wants, do anything
he wants.  Immigrants of every type in this country are being nabbed at at border and sent to concentration camps in El Salvador.
